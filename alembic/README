SiteSense Database Migrations
==============================

This directory contains Alembic database migrations for the SiteSense application.

## Common Commands

### Check current migration version
```bash
alembic current
```

### View migration history
```bash
alembic history
```

### Create a new migration (auto-generate from model changes)
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

### Apply all pending migrations
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rollback one migration
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

### Rollback to a specific version
```bash
alembic downgrade <revision_id>
```

## Configuration

- Database URL is automatically loaded from `backend/app/config.py`
- Models are imported from `backend/app/models.py`
- Migration scripts are stored in `alembic/versions/`

## Notes

- Always review auto-generated migrations before applying them
- Test migrations on a backup database before applying to production
- Both upgrade() and downgrade() functions should be implemented for each migration
